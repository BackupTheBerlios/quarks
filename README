Welcome to Quarks

Quarks is an experimental microkernel-based system I am writing in
my spare time. It is an attempt to implement such a project completely in C++
while maintaining source code readability, small footprint and speed.

For further documentation and how to build, install and run please read
the documentation in the doc directory.

Have fun.
